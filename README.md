# Translation

This repository holds all of the translation files for the [Rusty Helper](https://top.gg/bot/708645572906844190) discord bot.

Feel free to contribute and add translations in your own language

## Contributing

When contributing please create a pull request with your added translations.

## Project format

Each language and locale as it's own folder. Inside of that folder are other folders for different translation needs like commands and errors etc. Each folder contains multiple JSON formatted files which contain the raw translations. Look at `en-US` for an example of the English translations. 

Translation strings which have a variable in them will look like this:

en-GB

`Inventory cost for Ortovox` => `Inventory cost for {{user}}`

ru

`Стоимость инвентаря для Ortovox` => `Стоимость инвентаря для {{user}}`
